We examine whether a change in U.S. policy to normalize trade relations with China, which fueled a surge in import competition that led to higher levels of unemployment, affected the presence of hate crimes. Using a difference-in-differences model and an event-study framework, we find that areas most exposed to import competition experienced an increase in the number of anti-Black hate crimes. We also find a qualitatively similar effect on the number of active hate groups in response to import competition.
