This paper examines the effect of state level business cycle measures on the funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), relative to other schools. We find that when controlling for school characteristics, HBCU funding is very responsive to the business cycle—particularly downturns. Generally, HBCUs receive less funding than other institutions, but this result is exacerbated during periods of economic downturn. Our results are driven by 4-year institutions—the most common type of HBCU—and dissipates when only considering 2-year institutions.
