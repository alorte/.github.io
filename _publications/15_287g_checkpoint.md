This research examines whether the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) investigation into the Alamance County Sheriff's Office, a 287(g) program participant, influenced the policing behavior of other 287(g)-participating agencies in North Carolina. The study reveals that these agencies increased stops of Hispanic drivers at checkpoints following the DOJ lawsuit, indicating a strategic shift in response to potential DOJ scrutiny. Our findings suggest a phenomenon where 287(g) agencies, under threat of investigation, modify their discriminatory strategies, perpetuating racial and ethnic disparities in policing. This adds to the understanding of 287(g) and its role in fostering racial profiling.
