As the drug epidemic continues to cripple communities and disrupt our country, identifying and understanding state and federal policies which have helped alleviate the burden of substance use disorders (SUDs) is imperative. In 2010, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded health coverage and services offered to millions of Americans. Prior to the ACA, treatment for substance use disorders was not included in all medical coverage. We examine the brief literature on ACA Medicaid Expansion and SUDs and complement this literature by including the effects on measures of supply and efficacy of SUD treatment.
